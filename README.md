# Comparative Analysis of Coding Schemes for Error Rate Performance in AWGN and BSC Channels
 The aim of this project is to investigate and compare the performance of different coding schemes in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) over two commonly encountered channels, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC).  The project focuses on three specific coding schemes:  Linear Block Code: (15, 11) Hamming Code - This widely used error-correcting code is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in detecting and correcting errors. By studying its performance in the presence of AWGN and BSC, we can evaluate its suitability for reliable data transmission in these channels.  Cyclic Code: (15, 5) BCH Code - Cyclic codes are known for their ability to detect and correct burst errors, making them suitable for applications where consecutive error occurrences are likely. By analyzing the performance of the (15, 5) BCH code in AWGN and BSC channels, we can assess its efficiency in mitigating errors and preserving data integrity.  Convolutional Code: (3, 1, 4) Convolutional Code - Convolutional codes are a type of error-correcting code that operates on a stream of input bits, producing a coded sequence. This particular code has a rate of 1/3, meaning it encodes 1 input bit into 3 coded bits. By evaluating its performance over AWGN and BSC channels, we can assess its error-correcting capabilities and overall reliability.
